This is a long test message for the custom cipher. The Vigenere cipher, combined with a simple Caesar shift (and optional columnar transposition), should provide a decent level of security against basic frequency analysis. However, it is intentionally vulnerable to a known-plaintext attack for demonstration purposes. The key for the Vigenere cipher is NETWORKSECURITY, and the shift key is 7. This sample text is used for the demo and can be replaced with any A-Z text.
